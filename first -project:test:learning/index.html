      <h1>The Beauty of Tacos</h1>
    <img src="images/Tacos.jpeg" alt="Three platters of authentic tacos and dips">

    <h3>Tacos are top 2 and they aint no 2</h3>
    <p>This may seem contriversial to the uninitiated, but as they say, if you know 
        you know. In a game of Fuck, Mary, Kill between the usual suspects - pizza, 
        sushi, tacos - you marry the tacos. Every time. Tacos are the hug you need 
        after a hard day, the friend to get you hype, the easy enough the make at home
        and not leave you disappointed meal.</p>

    <h3>We don't discriminate we appreciate</h3>
    <p>Tacos come in all shapes and sizes and we love them all. Maybe not equally, 
        but still, it's love. Baja, Tex Mex, corn tortilla, flour tortilla, chicken
        seafood, beef cartinats, al pastor, the limits are endless. The limits are your
        imagination.</p>

<p> Tacos are</p>
<ul>
    <li>amazing</li>
    <li>delicious</li>
    <li>incredible</li>
</ul>
<p>and that's whey we love them</p>
